Run the program in Processing and read the instructions on the first page. When finished, press any key to start the quiz. Answer each question with either 'a', 'b', 'c', or 'd' as quickly as you can. After receiving feedback, press any key to go to the next question. A correct answer to a question will earn you 10 points. Press 'r' at any time to restart the quiz and go back to the start screen.

During the quiz, a timer bar will run on the bottom of the screen until all questions have been answered. At the end of the quiz, a userâ€™s score is totaled by multiplying the remaining time and the amount of points earned from answering questions correctly.

This project focused on extracting information from an XML document and determining whether user input satisfied a condition or not.
